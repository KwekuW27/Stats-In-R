#Certainly, let's perform another one-way ANOVA using a different dataset. We'll use the "PlantGrowth" dataset, 
#which is a built-in dataset in R that contains data on the growth of plants subjected to different treatments. 
#We'll analyze the plant growth based on the treatment they received.

#Here's how to conduct a one-way ANOVA on the "PlantGrowth" dataset:
#Load the Dataset (if not already loaded):
data(PlantGrowth)

#1. Perform One-Way ANOVA:
# One-way ANOVA for plant growth based on the treatment
anova_result <- aov(weight ~ group, data = PlantGrowth)

#. weight is the dependent variable (the weight of plants).
#. group is a categorical variable that represents different treatments for the plants.
#. data = PlantGrowth specifies the dataset to be used.

#1. View Summary of ANOVA Results:
summary(anova_result)

#The summary(anova_result) command will provide you with the ANOVA table, similar to the previous examples. 
#It will include information about the degrees of freedom, sum of squares, F-value, and p-value.
#Interpret the results as follows:
#The p-value associated with the F-value will determine whether there are significant differences 
#in plant growth based on the treatment. If the p-value is less than your chosen significance level 
#(e.g., 0.05), you can conclude that there are significant differences.
